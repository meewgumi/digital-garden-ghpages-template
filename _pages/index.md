This template was modified for Github Pages by [Megumi Tanaka](https://megumi.co). It is based on Maxime Vaillancourt's [digital garden jekyll template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll), originally running on Netlify. If this template helps you in any way, [consider buying Maxime a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/maximevaillancourt)! ‚òïÔ∏è
